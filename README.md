# hello-world
My first-ever Github repository! ^_^

I don't usually do tutorials.... but I'll do this one.

I work as a software developer, and I want to improve myself.

I am looking for interesting open-source projects to contribute to, as well as gain exposure to more technologies and frameworks.
